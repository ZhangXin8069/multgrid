## outline

### > Multigrid methods have been considered in the lattice QCD community as well, motivated by their potential (e.g., for elliptic PDEs) of convergence independent of the lattice spacing

### > Due to the random nature of the gauge fields involved, the treatment of the lattice Dirac equation by multigrid methods based solely on the underlying PDE, has been elusive for the last twenty years. With the advent of adaptive algebraic multigrid methods, effective preconditioners for QCD calculations could be constructed in recent years

## Algorithms in mathematical form
